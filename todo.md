- [x] Disallow impredicative universal types
- [x] Type inference
- [x] Idx inference
- [x] \(Kind-of) Allow `datatype` to have idx arguments that do not change.

- [x] Change syntax order of function name and `t` declares.
- [x] Be able to infer for `tree_map` and `tree_foldl`.
- [x] \(Partially) Have module system.
    Road map to add module system:
    * [x] Have a barebone module system with only modules, signatures, sealing, functors and `open`. No hierarchy (embeded modules), module alias, signature alias, `where`/`sharing`, `include`.
    * [ ] Combine name-resolve and typecheck.
    * [ ] Combine cctx and tctx into tctx.
    * [ ] Combine idx and type into constructors, sort and kind into kind, Combine sctx and kctx into kctx.
    * [ ] Add record types.
    * [ ] Add singleton kinds, dependent record kinds, dependent arrow kinds.
    * [ ] Elaborate modules and signatures into core language.
- [x] Bug of type inference in tree_append_rlm. The inferred type has `{n} tree tree` and `{n} list list`.
- [x] Put `Unit` back to mtype from `base_type` because `Unit` is not a base type like `Int` but a structural building block.
- [ ] Have a good error message when insertion_sort.timl/`insert` does not have the needed return-annotation on `case`.
- [x] Be able to infer for `insertion_sort`.
- [ ] `unify`'s `(UVar, UVar)` case could be dangerous: shift_invis may not be transactional, and there is no circularity check.
- [x] Have a standard library.
- [x] Automatically generate premises in `(VarP, Never)` case of `match_ptrn`, from complement cover of previous rules.
- [x] `case` should also copy `fun`'s `return` clause even without `using`.
- [ ] \(Abondoned. No problem.) `as` pattern may have a problem in `balance_left`.
- [x] Bug: redundancy checker runs forever on `balance_left`.
- [x] rbt.timl typecheckes when using ForgetError-less `subst` and ForgetError-full `forget`. Investigate why.
- [x] `find_habitant` can further simplify covers and speed up.
- [x] Have `type =` type aliasing.
- [x] Maximally insertion of index arguments.
- [x] Maximally insertion of index arguments in patterns.
- [x] nouvar-expr/passp/Imply/_ is not sound, possibly losing information.
- [ ] `subst_invis_no_throw` should be implemented in a safe way where uvars that can see the target variable are unified with a new shifted uvars that cannot see it, and `bring_forward_anchor` needs to be more sophisticated to only put new anchor when there is no shift (and the notifier in `Exists` needs to do some shift) because now not every uvar has an anchor.
- [x] Braun tree extraction.
- [x] rename "peel_" to "collect_".
- [x] Register admitted things.
- [ ] Make SMT batch response parsing smarter (do not check response length beforehand)

- [ ] Infer type according to pattern.
- [ ] Wrongly inferred `T_insert_delete_seq_0` to be (fn n => $n) without the `2.0 + 48.0 * $n` annotation. The source of the problem: unsoundness in bigO-solver.sml/solve_exists(). 
- [ ] Have some Nat/Time inference.
- [x] Unify `UnOpI`, `DivI` and `ExpI`.
- [x] Unify `True` and `False`.
- [x] Change `unify_s` to `is_sub_sort`.
- [x] Should apply solvers and check no-uvar after every module, not every file (unless we enforce one-module-per-file policy). 
- [ ] Move VC openings from `check_decl` to `check_decls`.
- [ ] `subst` should do lazy shifting, not eager.
- [x] The last two examples in bigO-evolve.timl about using `idx` instead of `absidx` does not work now.
- [x] Simplify unused `forall` in `prop`. The unused foralls are Big-O premises.
- [ ] `BigOEvolveSealed` in bigO-evolve.timl does not work yet.
- [x] if-then-else and list syntax.
- [ ] Restore the version of `link_sig` in revision 00ba072, because a module may have uvars before sealing, and uvars cannot be retrieved from a module.
- [ ] Big-O solver should heuristically distinguish "defining" side of `TimeFun` uvars from the "using" side, by the rule-of-thumb that only `_ <= f x` is a defining constraint of `f`.
- [ ] Do a module dependent analysis of each module and only bring the needed modules into `gctx` VC context.
- [x] Have double-linked lists.
- [x] rbt6.timl:  absidx sort `Time` inference error in `IntKey`.
- [x] Currently `absidx ... with ... end` is "scoped abstract index". We should have "unscoped" or "module-scoped" abstract index `absidx id = ...` so within the module `id`'s definition is visible but outside the module it is not.
- [ ] Make `kind`'s sorts dependent.
- [ ] Generate typing derivations.
- [x] Remove annotations on `case` (at least in a mode).
- [x] `datatype` can introduce index variable names at the first line for every constructor.
- [ ] `find_hab` is too slow on array-msort.timl on array-msort-inplace.timl
- [ ] A new unification framework ("skolemized unification"): every unification variable denotes a *closed* entity, which could be a lambda abstraction. For example, when we see type annotation [a : _] in the sorting context [x:Nat, y:Time], we introduce a uvar ?1 of kind [Nat => Time => Type], and replace the "_" with [AppV ?1 [x,y]]. When we try to unify [AppV ?1 [x,y]] with [int], in principle we can't conclude that [?1 = int]. But exploiting specific knowledge in this language, we can. When we can have such a definitive conclusion, we refine ?1 to be [int]; but when we can't have a definitive conclusion when doing unification, we should record it as a VC. For example, when we try to unify [AppV ?1 [x,y]] with [AppV ?2 [x,y]], we should put [AppV ?1 [x,y] = AppV ?2 [x,y]] in VC, instead of conclude that [?1 = ?2] (unless we want to do incomplete, over-aggressive unification).
- [ ] SML supports datatypes instantiated with different type arguments within a constructor, such as [datatype 'a ls = Nil | Cons of 'a * ('a * 'a) ls]. TiML's typechecker also supports this. So TiML's proof should also support this. It has usage in for example Okasaki's implicit queue (thesis Chapter 8).
